# House-rate-prediction-project-using-machine-learning
This project is used by the people for predicting the rate of house on the bases of there parameter like number of room, size of house and locality around the house etc. 
This project is made up Supervised learning model and Random Forest regression is fits the best in the model.
Data is collect form Housing boston dataset and this supervised learning model so Dataset is divided into two part training dataset and testing dataset and Random Forest regressor is applied to trained the model.   
Project build on python language and used the numpy , pandas and sklearn library for data cleaning and model building. For Model Training Linear Regression, Decision Tree regressor and Random Forest is used in which Random Forest regressor gives minimum root mean square value across all the methods and For testing Joblib library is used.
